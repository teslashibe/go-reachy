# Collaboration Rules

## Planning and Confirmation Rule

**Before implementing any code changes, features, or modifications:**

1. **Create a Plan**: Always develop a clear, detailed plan that outlines:
   - What changes will be made
   - Which files will be modified or created
   - The approach and methodology
   - Expected outcomes and impacts

2. **Confirm with User**: Present the plan to the user and wait for explicit confirmation before:
   - Making any file modifications
   - Creating new files
   - Running commands that modify the codebase
   - Implementing any suggested changes

3. **Get Approval**: Only proceed with implementation after receiving clear approval from the user.

4. **Do not commit after each step**: After completing each approved step or change, do not make a commit to the codebase to record progress and maintain a clear history.  This will be done manually by the user.

5. **No Assumptions**: Never assume the user wants changes implemented immediately, even if they seem obvious or beneficial.

**Exception**: Read-only operations (viewing files, searching, analyzing) do not require prior confirmation.

This rule ensures we maintain collaborative control over the codebase and prevents unwanted changes.
